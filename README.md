# SR2-PC-Lobby-Lobby-Swapper-Tool
This tool allows you to change the MP lobby map to be different maps, including my ported maps from sp.
When swapping the lobby map if you ever go to start a lan or online game and get kicked back to the mainmenu
this is normal, it's due to the map you are changing to being a longer than normal name. Keep going back to lan or
online till you get into the lobby with the changed map. You will eventually get in. 

You can watch this video as a example of what the tool does and how it works
